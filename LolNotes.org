*** [Gold 3] Miss Fortune Coaching | Lane Phase, Mid Game Tactics
 How to analyse laning phase
 - 1v1 & 2v2 win conditions
   - CC
   - Damage
   - Sustain
 
 Sustain Lanes
   - Take trades and sustain
     - Force them to back
     - Create dive pressure
     - Zone them
     - Make them call for a gank
     
 Trading
   - Trade when you're strong and when they're weak
     - Queue to go in if enemy has low value ability
     - Go in when your abilities are up, else you have no value

  How to analyse gank
   - What need to happen for you to die
     - Key CC abilities
   - Flash to guarantee an advantage in lane and in the game
     - If jungle gank fails, he lose time (no farm, lost pressure) and your jungle has a free play
   - You WANT to be ganked
     - You don't want to DIE to the gank
     - Or take people with you
   - Gank lose conditions
     - Low HP (give enemy more win conditions)
     - No flash

   Back timing
     - Reasons to back
       - You can push them in tower and get a free back
       - Push for cannon wave if you need to back but cant
         - Slow push until the wave the last wave before the cannon, then push it in
       - If you have no choice, just back

   Level 6 analysis
     - New win/lose conditions based on Rs
      
   Have a plan for fights (Poke, Trade, Ganks, Fights)
